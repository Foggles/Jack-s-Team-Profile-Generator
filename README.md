## Description
This a project that allows the user to create a html page that contains the information of the members of their team.

## Installation
Clone the GitHub Repository to your device, navigate to it in your terminal, and input "node .\index.js".

## Usage
The user first needs to input the name, employee ID, email address and office number of the team's manager. They will then be prompted with a menu asking the user to select between "Engineer", "Intern" or  "Finish". If the user selects either of the first two, they be prompted to input information for the Engineers and/or Interns on their team - both lead to the same menu where the user can select from the three options. If the user selects "Finish", an index.html file will be created that will contain the information that the user entered in card format.
